Design and Colour Scheme

I chose Edvard Munch's The Sun as the key image of my hero because I think it is a calming image that sets a nice tone for the webpage. I generated the palette for the website from the painting so that I could maintain a consistent palette, aiming for a palette that evoked a sunrise, which I think is an encouraging theme for people going through mental health issues.

It should be noted that the original painting was intended to display the masculine dominance of nature, and is a lot harsher in it's palette. I chose a brightened version of an image of the painting.
